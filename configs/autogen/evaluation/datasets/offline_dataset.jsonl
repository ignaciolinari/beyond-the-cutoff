These dimensions highlight the strengths and generalizability of Orion-MSP compared to other models [1].\n\n- **Dataset Size**: Performance trends reveal that Orion-MSP consistently performs well across small, medium, and large datasets. Classical ML models like XGBoost excel on large datasets due to abundant training examples but Orion-MSP maintains competitive performance across all size categories, showcasing its robustness in low-data regimes while scaling effectively [1].\n\n- **Feature Dimensionality**: Orion-MSP shows the highest accuracy on narrow datasets (<10 features) and strong performance on medium and wide datasets (10–100 and >100 features). This indicates that sparse multi-scale attention enables effective learning even in high-dimensional feature spaces, where dense models like TabICL struggle with scalability [1].\n\n- **Class Imbalance**: Orion-MSP achieves its strongest gains on imbalanced datasets, ranking second overall. The model's design effectively amplifies signals from underrepresented classes while avoiding overfitting to dominant classes, making it particularly advantageous for datasets exhibiting skewed distributions [1].", "rag": {"prompt": "You are a research paper assistant.

TABPFN follows closely, attaining an overall rank of 4. 61 and scores of 0. 8514/0. 8412 on TALENT and up to 0. 8752/0. 8716 on TabZilla. TABDPT ranks 5. 42, achieving 0. 8408/0. 8318 on TALENT and 0. 8814/0. 8775 on TabZilla. By contrast, Mitra (rank 11. 77, ACC < 0. 40) and ContextTab (rank 9. 70) perform substantially worse, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical multi-scale processing and efficient attention in Orion-MSP. Overall, TABPFN and ORION-MSP emerge as the strongest models, with ACC ranging from 0. 85 to 0. 88 and ranks between 3. 26 and 4. 61. ORION-MSP peaks on OpenML-CC18 (rank 4. 12, ACC 0. 8722) and TabZilla (rank 3. 84, ACC 0. 8821), while TABPFN leads on TALENT (ACC 0. 8514) and maintains stable performance across all benchmark suites. To further investigate the sources of Orion-MSP’s performance gains, we analyze results across key dataset characteris- tics. All analyses partition datasets based on inherent properties rather than performance outcomes. Dataset Size. Table 2 reports model performance aggregated by dataset size: Small (< 1K samples), Medium (1K-10K), and Large (> 10). Performance trends reveal that Orion-MSP consistently performs well across small, medium, and large datasets. Classical ML models such as XGBoost excel on large datasets due to abundant training examples, achieving the highest ACC/F1 in the > 10K sample category. Orion-MSP, however, maintains competitive performance across all size categories, outperforming most baselines on small and medium datasets. This demonstrates the ability of multi-scale sparse attention to generalize effectively in low-data regimes while scaling gracefully to larger datasets. TabPFN also performs strongly, particularly on medium-sized datasets, but Orion-MSP’s consistent performance across size scales highlights the robustness of its hierarchical and sparse design. Feature Dimensionality. Table 3 presents performance trends across narrow (< 10 features), medium (10 - 100) and wide ( > 100) datasets. When evaluating dataset width, Orion-MSP shows the highest accuracy on narrow datasets (<10 features) and strong performance on medium and wide datasets (10–100 and >100 features). This suggests that sparse multi-scale attention enables effective learning even in high-dimensional feature spaces, where dense models such as TabICL exhibit diminished scalability to high-dimensional feature spaces. Based on Class Imbalance. Partitioning datasets based on class balance reveals that Orion-MSP achieves its strongest gains on imbalanced datasets. The model ranks second in this category, achieving ACC = 0. 8840 and F1 = 0. 8731. This highlights that multi-scale sparse attention amplifies signals from underrepresented classes while avoiding overfitting to dominant classes. On balanced datasets, performance gains are smaller, suggesting that the architectural complexity of Orion-MSP is most advantageous when datasets exhibit skewed distributions. In comparison, TabPFN maintains strong performance on both balanced and imbalanced datasets, but Orion-MSP’s design more effectively addresses minority-class patterns due to hierarchical attention and cross-scale reasoning. Domain-specific Analysis. Domain-wise evaluation provides deeper insight into Orion-MSP’s strengths (Table 5): • Medical datasets: Orion-MSP achieves the highest ACC = 0. 8045 and F1 = 0. 7916, ranking second overall behind Orion-BiX. These datasets often involve hierarchical biological structures and complex interdepen- dencies among features, which align naturally with Orion-MSP’s multi-scale representation. Fine-grained scales capture local dependencies, while coarser scales aggregate contextual information, leading to improved predictive accuracy. 16 Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning Table 3 Performance variation by feature dimensionality (dataset width) across all benchmark suites.

TABPFN follows closely, attaining an overall rank of 4. 61 and scores of 0. 8514/0. 8412 on TALENT and up to 0. 8752/0. 8716 on TabZilla. TABDPT ranks 5. 42, achieving 0. 8408/0. 8318 on TALENT and 0. 8814/0. 8775 on TabZilla. By contrast, Mitra (rank 11. 77, ACC < 0. 40) and ContextTab (rank 9. 70) perform substantially worse, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical multi-scale processing and efficient attention in Orion-MSP. Overall, TABPFN and ORION-MSP emerge as the strongest models, with ACC ranging from 0. 85 to 0. 88 and ranks between 3. 26 and 4. 61. ORION-MSP peaks on OpenML-CC18 (rank 4. 12, ACC 0. 8722) and TabZilla (rank 3. 84, ACC 0. 8821), while TABPFN leads on TALENT (ACC 0. 8514) and maintains stable performance across all benchmark suites. To further investigate the sources of Orion-MSP’s performance gains, we analyze results across key dataset characteris- tics. All analyses partition datasets based on inherent properties rather than performance outcomes. Dataset Size. Table 2 reports model performance aggregated by dataset size: Small (< 1K samples), Medium (1K-10K), and Large (> 10). Performance trends reveal that Orion-MSP consistently performs well across small, medium, and large datasets. Classical ML models such as XGBoost excel on large datasets due to abundant training examples, achieving the highest ACC/F1 in the > 10K sample category. Orion-MSP, however, maintains competitive performance across all size categories, outperforming most baselines on small and medium datasets. This demonstrates the ability of multi-scale sparse attention to generalize effectively in low-data regimes while scaling gracefully to larger datasets. TabPFN also performs strongly, particularly on medium-sized datasets, but Orion-MSP’s consistent performance across size scales highlights the robustness of its hierarchical and sparse design. Feature Dimensionality. Table 3 presents performance trends across narrow (< 10 features), medium (10 - 100) and wide ( > 100) datasets. When evaluating dataset width, Orion-MSP shows the highest accuracy on narrow datasets (<10 features) and strong performance on medium and wide datasets (10–100 and >100 features). This suggests that sparse multi-scale attention enables effective learning even in high-dimensional feature spaces, where dense models such as TabICL exhibit diminished scalability to high-dimensional feature spaces. Based on Class Imbalance. Partitioning datasets based on class balance reveals that Orion-MSP achieves its strongest gains on imbalanced datasets. The model ranks second in this category, achieving ACC = 0. 8840 and F1 = 0. 8731. This highlights that multi-scale sparse attention amplifies signals from underrepresented classes while avoiding overfitting to dominant classes. On balanced datasets, performance gains are smaller, suggesting that the architectural complexity of Orion-MSP is most advantageous when datasets exhibit skewed distributions. In comparison, TabPFN maintains strong performance on both balanced and imbalanced datasets, but Orion-MSP’s design more effectively addresses minority-class patterns due to hierarchical attention and cross-scale reasoning. Domain-specific Analysis. Domain-wise evaluation provides deeper insight into Orion-MSP’s strengths (Table 5): • Medical datasets: Orion-MSP achieves the highest ACC = 0. 8045 and F1 = 0. 7916, ranking second overall behind Orion-BiX. These datasets often involve hierarchical biological structures and complex interdepen- dencies among features, which align naturally with Orion-MSP’s multi-scale representation. Fine-grained scales capture local dependencies, while coarser scales aggregate contextual information, leading to improved predictive accuracy. 16 Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning Table 3 Performance variation by feature dimensionality (dataset width) across all benchmark suites.

This increased investment can drive the platform (e.g., Google) to support software innovation as well, aiming for ecological benefits and overall supply chain returns [1]. However, if the manufacturer's overconfidence is too high, it can lead to aggressive pricing strategies that may backfire, causing the platform to become conservative in its innovation investments. This dynamic highlights how the level of overconfidence influences the balance between hardware and software innovations and ultimately impacts profit distribution among manufacturers and platforms [1].\n\n[1] Section: 4.3 Comparison of overconfidence and no overconfidence | Page 23", "rag": {"prompt": "You are a research paper assistant.

Specifically, the study suggests that increased reported leisure time spent in the presence of one's partner is associated with higher tolerance for controlling or abusive behavior [1]. This finding indicates that co-presence alone does not guarantee egalitarian interaction but may coexist with underlying imbalances in decision-making power and control over resources, such as finances. These dynamics are critical because they can normalize justifications for control within relationships, thereby potentially increasing the acceptability of domestic violence. Thus, alongside measures of gender norms and financial autonomy, leisure time diaries provide a nuanced understanding of how relationship structures impact attitudes toward domestic violence.\n\n[1] This conclusion is drawn from the broader context provided in [1], which highlights that while co-presence can be observed, it does not necessarily reflect equal power dynamics. Instead, factors such as control over household resources and financial decision-making play significant roles in shaping attitudes toward domestic violence.", "rag": {"prompt": "You are a research paper assistant.

Meanwhile, measures of gender norms, masculinity ideals, and parenthood expectations help contextualize these attitudes within the cultural beliefs that legitimize or challenge control, dominance, and traditional role divisions. For instance, endorsing beliefs that men should be the primary breadwinners or that working mothers harm children may correlate with a higher tolerance for controlling or abusive behavior. Attitudes toward domestic violence may be distributed along a continuum shaped by both gender norms and contextual triggers as prior research in economic psychology and development studies demonstrates. Reitmanna et al. (2020), in a survey experiment conducted in Tunisia, found that priming respondents with information about the prevalence of domestic violence significantly reduced its acceptability among men, while framing questions around equality further dampened tolerance among both genders. These effects suggest that cultural norms surrounding violence are not immutable, but rather malleable in response to framing and information cues. Importantly, these dynamics may be intensified or mitigated by the degree of economic autonomy within couples. Similarly, understanding domestic violence requires not only measuring individual attitudes but also situating them within broader household structures and economic arrangements. Financial management within couples is rarely neutral or purely pragmatic. Rather, control over money often reflects gendered power asymmetries that can shape relationship dynamics and, in some contexts, exacerbate vulnerability to intimate partner violence (Pahl, 1989; Kirchler, 1995). Male-controlled financial systems tend to concentrate discretionary decision-making and personal spending in men’s hands, particularly in higher-income households, while female-controlled systems are typically more constrained and associated with budgeting for family necessities (Pahl, 1989). These patterns may contribute to household environments where financial dependence or exclusion amplifies the risk of coercive behaviors and normative justifications of violence. 7 Figure 1: Vignettes on parenthood norms In this light, the correlation between unequal financial management systems and attitudes justifying violence can be interpreted through the lens of constrained autonomy. When individuals lack control over their own time or money— two fundamental resources—the space for negotiation narrows, and justifications for control may become normalized. This is particularly relevant in couples where traditional gender roles are internalized or where masculinity is closely tied to authority (Meier-Pesti Penz, 2008). The inclusion of both time diaries and vignette-based attitudinal items makes it possible to go beyond stated preferences and observe lived experience, a methodological advancement echoed by Kirchler (1995) and Pahl (1989). The TIMES dataset provides a rare opportunity to investigate interrelated mechanisms within households. By capturing time-use behaviors alongside attitudinal measures from both partners, it allows for an empirical examination of whether economic decision-making—such as control over household resources or child-rearing time —correlates with higher tolerance for domestic violence or with more traditional views of gender roles. Such an approach aligns with calls for a deeper behavioral analysis of power in the domestic sphere. Thus, alongside gender gaps in time devoted to unpaid work, I also construct, from time-use diaries, two behavioral outcome variables used in Section 6. Time spent in leisure with partner: Total weekly hours spent in the presence of one’s partner doing activities classified as leisure. These include reading, using social media, watching TV or movies, listening to music or podcasts, exercising, engaging in creative activities, browsing the internet, playing video games, gardening, socializing (e. g. , visiting friends or family, dining out, attending events), as well as time spent sleeping and on personal care. This definition is a broader version of that used by (Agüiar and Hurst, 2007). Time spent in leisure with partner and children: Total weekly hours spent jointly with both partner and children engaging in the above-defined leisure activities. Only primary activities are considered in constructing these variables. Figure 2 shows the distribution of weekly hours that participants reported spending leisure time with their partner and with their children. 8 Figure 2: Distribution of time-use outcomes (weekly hours)\n\nQuestion: How does the study suggest leisure time affects attitudes towards domestic violence?\nAnswer:", "contexts": ["[1] Section: 3.1.1.3 Gender gap in unpaid work | Page 6\nrespondents’ immediate reactions to realistic scenarios, including their assessment of the seriousness of the behavior, attribution of responsibility, and degree of victim-blaming—dimensions that are central to how domestic violence is perceived, tolerated, or condemned in society.

(2020), in a survey experiment conducted in Tunisia, found that priming respondents with information about the prevalence of domestic violence significantly reduced its acceptability among men, while framing questions around equality further dampened tolerance among both genders. These effects suggest that cultural norms surrounding violence are not immutable, but rather malleable in response to framing and information cues. Importantly, these dynamics may be intensified or mitigated by the degree of economic autonomy within couples. Similarly, understanding domestic violence requires not only measuring individual attitudes but also situating them within broader household structures and economic arrangements. Financial management within couples is rarely neutral or purely pragmatic. Rather, control over money often reflects gendered power asymmetries that can shape relationship dynamics and, in some contexts, exacerbate vulnerability to intimate partner violence (Pahl, 1989; Kirchler, 1995). Male-controlled financial systems tend to concentrate discretionary decision-making and personal spending in men’s hands, particularly in higher-income households, while female-controlled systems are typically more constrained and associated with budgeting for family necessities (Pahl, 1989). These patterns may contribute to household environments where financial dependence or exclusion amplifies the risk of coercive behaviors and normative justifications of violence. 7 Figure 1: Vignettes on parenthood norms In this light, the correlation between unequal financial management systems and attitudes justifying violence can be interpreted through the lens of constrained autonomy. When individuals lack control over their own time or money— two fundamental resources—the space for negotiation narrows, and justifications for control may become normalized. This is particularly relevant in couples where traditional gender roles are internalized or where masculinity is closely tied to authority (Meier-Pesti Penz, 2008). The inclusion of both time diaries and vignette-based attitudinal items makes it possible to go beyond stated preferences and observe lived experience, a methodological advancement echoed by Kirchler (1995) and Pahl (1989). The TIMES dataset provides a rare opportunity to investigate interrelated mechanisms within households. By capturing time-use behaviors alongside attitudinal measures from both partners, it allows for an empirical examination of whether economic decision-making—such as control over household resources or child-rearing time —correlates with higher tolerance for domestic violence or with more traditional views of gender roles. Such an approach aligns with calls for a deeper behavioral analysis of power in the domestic sphere. Thus, alongside gender gaps in time devoted to unpaid work, I also construct, from time-use diaries, two behavioral outcome variables used in Section 6. Time spent in leisure with partner: Total weekly hours spent in the presence of one’s partner doing activities classified as leisure. These include reading, using social media, watching TV or movies, listening to music or podcasts, exercising, engaging in creative activities, browsing the internet, playing video games, gardening, socializing (e. g. , visiting friends or family, dining out, attending events), as well as time spent sleeping and on personal care. This definition is a broader version of that used by (Agüiar and Hurst, 2007). Time spent in leisure with partner and children: Total weekly hours spent jointly with both partner and children engaging in the above-defined leisure activities. Only primary activities are considered in constructing these variables.

Detailed Sentiment Data. Source: Authors’ own work. 4. 8 Summary Overall, the model’s replies were predominantly warm, empathic, and positively valenced, with moderate run-to-run stability. Outliers—chiefly “confusion” labels and larger sentiment swings—were infrequent but present, providing quantitative entry-points for the discussion that follows. The application of GPT in the field of psychological counseling shows significant promise, primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the responses generated.

The results are shown in Table 3. Similar to the results on the Nymeria dataset, despite HAGI++ not being trained or fine-tuned on these datasets, it achieved the lowest MAE across all methods and missing ratios, with a minimum improve- ment of 13. 2%, a maximum improvement of 22. 0%, and an average improvement of 19. 2% over the second-best method that does not utilise head information. Moreover, the additional 2. 4% average im- provement over HAGI across all missing ratios demonstrates that the new model architecture more effectively captures eye–head co- ordination. Finally, HAGI++ attained a comparable JS divergence to HAGI, indicating that its imputed gaze velocity distribution re- mains close to the natural human gaze dynamics. Moreover, it is worth noting that in the cross-dataset evaluation, the absolute MAE across different missing ratios did not decrease compared with the within-dataset results on the Nymeria dataset (see Table 1). This suggests that HAGI++ learns robust correlations between eye and head movements that generalise well across datasets featuring di- verse everyday activities and environments, demonstrating strong generalisation performance and reflecting the benefits of training on a larger and more diverse dataset. Qualitative results. We present four sample gaze imputation re- sults from the cross-dataset evaluation for five methods with rela- tively low MAE in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, HAGI++ benefits from the incorporation of head movement information, producing imputed gaze trajectories that more closely follow the ground-truth human eye movements both spatially and temporally. At 30% and 50% missing ratios, HAGI++ exhibits a trajectory trend that is closer to the ground truth compared with HAGI, highlighting the effective- ness of the new architecture. Even in the challenging scenario with 90% missing values, both HAGI++ and HAGI generate gaze sam- ples that remain well aligned with the ground truth.

Detailed Sentiment Data. Source: Authors’ own work. 4. 8 Summary Overall, the model’s replies were predominantly warm, empathic, and positively valenced, with moderate run-to-run stability. Outliers—chiefly “confusion” labels and larger sentiment swings—were infrequent but present, providing quantitative entry-points for the discussion that follows. The application of GPT in the field of psychological counseling shows significant promise, primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the responses generated. Most GPT outputs are empathetic and supportive, which are critical attributes in therapeutic settings. Positive interactions in therapy are known to enhance client engagement and satisfaction, thereby contributing to more effective therapeutic alliances and outcomes. However, it is important to acknowledge that GPT also produces non-positive and even confusing responses in certain instances, indicating some issues with the stability and reliability of its outputs."}, {"id": 1313, "source_path": "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.02587.txt", "page": 4, "section_title": "Abstract", "token_start": 6102, "token_end": 6691, "score": 0.13652780652046204, "excerpt": ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ....", "rendered_context": "[3] Section: Abstract | Page 4\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 1.

Having observed that the datasets were heavy-tailed, it fit exponential, power law and lognormal distributions to synapse number and de- gree, concluding that “neuron-level degree and synapse counts are. . . most parsimoniously described by log-normal” distributions (Figure 4d), thereby recapitulating the results presented in Figure 2A,D of Piazza et al. [15]. Second, having identified patterns indicating power-law scaling between synapses, length and degree (Figure 4c), Kosmos finds that “Log-log regressions of synapse count versus neurite length showed robust power-law scaling in seven of eight datasets,” thus capturing Figure 3A,G, as well as equation 5, of the preprint [15] (Figure 4d). In order to validate these findings, the researchers compared the mean (µ) of the lognormals fitted by Kosmos with the values reported in the preprint, and found high concordance between the two, with most estimates falling within one standard deviation of the published values (Pearson’s r = 0. 77 for Synapses, r = 0. 46 for Degrees) (Figure 4e).", "ordinal": 1}, {"id": 438, "text": "Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM), 10. 1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013 Published version: Yang Ni, Yanzhuo Cao; Exploring ChatGPT’s capabilities, stability, potential and risks in conducting psychological counseling through simulations in school counseling.

This context supports the use of pre-labeling as a response to the delays and limitations imposed by BP’s data access policies, which are key findings from the BP context.\n\nIn summary, the key finding regarding the pre-labeling strategy used in the BP context is that it was employed locally to address bureaucratic constraints on data access and authorization, thus maintaining development speed but weakening traceability [1].", "rag": {"prompt": "You are a research paper assistant.

Finding O2: Bureaucracy to obtain Credentials and authoriza- tion to access data. The bureaucracy of BP’s data access policy proved decisive for development cadence and the reliability of ana- lytical artifacts. Although the Airflow, DBT, and Postgres services remained technically stable, dependence on government infras- tructure teams for hosting and security, the use of a VPN, partial access grants, and rotating secrets subjected the flow to mediated approvals and time-limited authorization windows, shifting the critical path from code readiness to credentials [#IN1, #IN2, #IN3]. In practice, lead time came to depend on authorization queues, downstream materializations were postponed, and comparisons across runs lost robustness. To maintain cadence, teams resorted to local arrangements such as pre-labeling and ad hoc sampling, which preserve speed but weaken central traceability and reinforce the static delivery pattern described in O1, making it harder to detect data drift and to reproduce results. In terms of data maturity, BP is at an intermediate stage consistent with levels 1 to 2 of the DataOps Maturity Model, with manual deliveries, low automation, and informal processes. The effect is primarily organizational: the absence of a manageable and reproducible pipeline shifts effort to manual reconstruction and validation, reducing the time available for analysis and modeling. “Our biggest obstacle is the bureaucracy to get access to any data or tool (. . . ) requests usually take two to three months, and initial database access took six to eight months. ” (E1) Finding O3: No data catalog and no explicit rules. Even with a central code repository on GitLab and the use of Metabase for querying and visualization, BP lacks a governed space that consol- idates a data dictionary, business rules, accountable owners, and lineage across layers. In practice, metric definitions and transfor- mation logic remain dispersed across notebooks and repositories, which produce variations in calculations and require manual re- construction of criteria whenever results are compared. Metabase serves for exploration and dashboarding, but it does not replace a versioned catalog with data contracts, owners, change history, and explicit dependencies; nor does it provide a single, auditable register of rules applied outside the cards and queries themselves. This fragmented arrangement hinders the reuse of variables for modeling, weakens end-to-end traceability and data drift detec- tion, and increases the cost of auditing and reproducibility. The organizational effect is clear: without a catalog and a systematic mapping of rules, cycle time comes to depend on tacit knowledge and ad hoc validations, with a greater risk of inconsistencies across environments and decisions. 5. 1. 3 Governance and auditability. Finding G1: Fragmented lin- eage and restricted re-execution. In the analyzed period, trace- ability was concentrated in the code repository and analytical arti- facts such as commits, notebooks, result tables, and synthetic gener- ation files, but without a single chain linking file-delivered dataset cuts, transformations, parameters, LLM prompts, checkpoints, and inference logs through stable IDs [#I6]. In practice, we reproduced runs deterministically when remaining within the same data drop and the same code commit, supported by logs, seeds, and local notes [#N3, #N5, #N6, #P1, #P4]. When crossing different drops, version comparisons required manual reconciliation of inputs and interme- diate decisions and, in some cases, it was not possible to reconstruct a prior output exactly. From a governance and auditability stand- point, the evidence trail exists but is fragmented by artifact and time period, which limits fine-grained differential analyses across versions and complicates retroactive investigations into regressions or model decisions. Finding G2: Limited per-version observability. The produc- tion service is recent and, within the observed window, did not accumulate consolidated per-version time series for p95 and p99 latency, per-class error, or confidence distributions [#AE14, #I8]. Available monitoring remained closer to operational signals such as availability and logs, while analytical per-version readings derived mainly from experiments that mirrored system behavior in test environments. This arrangement allowed us to compare configura- tions, estimate latency costs, and observe per-class error variations, but without temporal continuity per version in production. From a governance standpoint, regression detection and explanation were feasible but anchored in experimental cycles [#N3, #N5, #C1, #C9, #C11, #P4] rather than operational per-version series, which increased the effort to assemble retrospective dashboards and to associate behavior changes with specific releases, especially under a routed topology.

To maintain cadence, teams resorted to local arrangements such as pre-labeling and ad hoc sampling, which preserve speed but weaken central traceability and reinforce the static delivery pattern described in O1, making it harder to detect data drift and to reproduce results. In terms of data maturity, BP is at an intermediate stage consistent with levels 1 to 2 of the DataOps Maturity Model, with manual deliveries, low automation, and informal processes. The effect is primarily organizational: the absence of a manageable and reproducible pipeline shifts effort to manual reconstruction and validation, reducing the time available for analysis and modeling. “Our biggest obstacle is the bureaucracy to get access to any data or tool (. . . ) requests usually take two to three months, and initial database access took six to eight months. ” (E1) Finding O3: No data catalog and no explicit rules. Even with a central code repository on GitLab and the use of Metabase for querying and visualization, BP lacks a governed space that consol- idates a data dictionary, business rules, accountable owners, and lineage across layers. In practice, metric definitions and transfor- mation logic remain dispersed across notebooks and repositories, which produce variations in calculations and require manual re- construction of criteria whenever results are compared. Metabase serves for exploration and dashboarding, but it does not replace a versioned catalog with data contracts, owners, change history, and explicit dependencies; nor does it provide a single, auditable register of rules applied outside the cards and queries themselves. This fragmented arrangement hinders the reuse of variables for modeling, weakens end-to-end traceability and data drift detec- tion, and increases the cost of auditing and reproducibility. The organizational effect is clear: without a catalog and a systematic mapping of rules, cycle time comes to depend on tacit knowledge and ad hoc validations, with a greater risk of inconsistencies across environments and decisions. 5. 1. 3 Governance and auditability. Finding G1: Fragmented lin- eage and restricted re-execution. In the analyzed period, trace- ability was concentrated in the code repository and analytical arti- facts such as commits, notebooks, result tables, and synthetic gener- ation files, but without a single chain linking file-delivered dataset cuts, transformations, parameters, LLM prompts, checkpoints, and inference logs through stable IDs [#I6]. In practice, we reproduced runs deterministically when remaining within the same data drop and the same code commit, supported by logs, seeds, and local notes [#N3, #N5, #N6, #P1, #P4]. When crossing different drops, version comparisons required manual reconciliation of inputs and interme- diate decisions and, in some cases, it was not possible to reconstruct a prior output exactly. From a governance and auditability stand- point, the evidence trail exists but is fragmented by artifact and time period, which limits fine-grained differential analyses across versions and complicates retroactive investigations into regressions or model decisions. Finding G2: Limited per-version observability. The produc- tion service is recent and, within the observed window, did not accumulate consolidated per-version time series for p95 and p99 latency, per-class error, or confidence distributions [#AE14, #I8]. Available monitoring remained closer to operational signals such as availability and logs, while analytical per-version readings derived mainly from experiments that mirrored system behavior in test environments. This arrangement allowed us to compare configura- tions, estimate latency costs, and observe per-class error variations, but without temporal continuity per version in production. From a governance standpoint, regression detection and explanation were feasible but anchored in experimental cycles [#N3, #N5, #C1, #C9, #C11, #P4] rather than operational per-version series, which increased the effort to assemble retrospective dashboards and to associate behavior changes with specific releases, especially under a routed topology. Finding G3: Late and intermittent human sampling. For much of the period, quality assessment centered on automatic met- rics of coherence and diversity, ARI and NMI, and F1 and macro-F1.", "ordinal": 1}]}, "metadata": {"source_path": "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.01545.txt", "generator_model": "qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M", "generator_run_id": "cb76eb2c-1db7-414a-b721-7a0e11f36695", "document_index": 2, "task_index": 1, "require_citations": true, "retrieved_chunk_ids": [60], "retrieved_section_titles": ["Decisions"], "selected_chunk_ids": [53, 57, 58, 62, 64, 66], "generator_metadata": {"question": "What were the key findings regarding the pre-labeling strategy used in the BP context?", "answer": "The pre-labeling was performed using the gemma3:12b model locally.

Pearson’s r served as a descriptive measure of association between question length and average response length (Kirch, 2008). The correlation analysis aimed to identify if longer questions tend to elicit longer responses from GPT. 3. 9 Ethical Considerations This study did not involve any direct interactions with human or animal subjects. The data were anonymized and made publicly available to ensure compliance with ethical standards. This study involved no direct interaction with living human (or animal) participants. All analyses were carried out on the publicly released ChatCounselor corpus (Liu et al., 2023), which is hosted on GitHub/Hugging-Face as a fully de-identified JSONL file: user names, dates, IP logs and any other HIPAA- or GDPR-protected identifiers were removed by the original curators prior to publication. The forum’s terms of service permit non-commercial redistribution for research, and the dataset is distributed under an open licence. According to U. S. federal regulations 45 CFR 46. 102 and 46. 104(d)(4)—which exclude “publicly available, de-identified data” from the definition of human-subjects research—such secondary analysis does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. Our institution’s publicly posted Human Research Protection guidance concurs: projects limited to public, fully anonymised datasets are not considered human-subjects research and may proceed without IRB submission. We therefore determined that the present exploratory study is Not-Human-Subjects Research. No re-identification was attempted, no linkage with other data sources occurred, and no contact was made with the original posters. 3. 10 Methodological Limitations This work is based entirely on offline text simulations: eighty previously posted student queries were fed to a single model version (GPT-4-0613, accessed 15 July 2024) and analyzed with automated NLP tools. Statistics are therefore descriptive flags, not confirmatory tests, and the behavior of other LLM versions or alternative chatbots may diverge sharply from the patterns reported here. Because no live users or clinicians interacted with the system, the study cannot speak to real-time usability, safety, or conversational dynamics. A second limitation concerns external validity and measurement. Warmth, empathy, and acceptance were inferred by machine-learning models rather than by human raters, while crucial clinical outcomes, such as symptom change or client satisfaction, were not observed. Consequently, the present findings should be read as an exploratory, hypothesis-generating snapshot rather than evidence of effectiveness; rigorous user studies, multi-model replications and mixed-methods validation remain essential before any real-world deployment of ChatGPT in psychological counseling. A third limitation is the lack of direct input from the relevant people this technology is meant to serve. We did not collect any usability or acceptability feedback from adolescent users or professional school counselors, leaving open questions about how warmth, empathy, and", "[4] Section: Count | Page 19\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript (AAM), 10. 1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013 Published version: Yang Ni, Yanzhuo Cao; Exploring ChatGPT’s capabilities, stability, potential and risks in conducting psychological counseling through simulations in school counseling.

Detailed Sentiment Data. Source: Authors’ own work. 4. 8 Summary Overall, the model’s replies were predominantly warm, empathic, and positively valenced, with moderate run-to-run stability. Outliers—chiefly “confusion” labels and larger sentiment swings—were infrequent but present, providing quantitative entry-points for the discussion that follows. The application of GPT in the field of psychological counseling shows significant promise, primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the responses generated. Most GPT outputs are empathetic and supportive, which are critical attributes in therapeutic settings. Positive interactions in therapy are known to enhance client engagement and satisfaction, thereby contributing to more effective therapeutic alliances and outcomes. However, it is important to acknowledge that GPT also produces non-positive and even confusing responses in certain instances, indicating some issues with the stability and reliability of its outputs."], "sources": ["/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.02587.txt#page=4", "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.02109.txt#page=16", "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.01788.txt#page=10", "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.01788.txt#page=19"], "scores": [0.14672930538654327, 0.10921256244182587, 0.07930494099855423, 0.02802959457039833], "citations": [{"id": 1313, "source_path": "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.02587.txt", "page": 4, "section_title": "Abstract", "token_start": 6102, "token_end": 6691, "score": 0.14672930538654327, "excerpt": ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ....", "rendered_context": "[1] Section: Abstract | Page 4\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 1.

The correlation analysis aimed to identify if longer questions tend to elicit longer responses from GPT. 3. 9 Ethical Considerations This study did not involve any direct interactions with human or animal subjects. The data were anonymized and made publicly available to ensure compliance with ethical standards. This study involved no direct interaction with living human (or animal) participants. All analyses were carried out on the publicly released ChatCounselor corpus (Liu et al., 2023), which is hosted on GitHub/Hugging-Face as a fully de-identified JSONL file: user names, dates, IP logs and any other HIPAA- or GDPR-protected identifiers were removed by the original curators prior to publication. The forum’s terms of service permit non-commercial redistribution for research, and the dataset is distributed under an open licence. According to U. S. federal regulations 45 CFR 46. 102 and 46. 104(d)(4)—which exclude “publicly available, de-identified data” from the definition of human-subjects research—such secondary analysis does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. Our institution’s publicly posted Human Research Protection guidance concurs: projects limited to public, fully anonymised datasets are not considered human-subjects research and may proceed without IRB submission. We therefore determined that the present exploratory study is Not-Human-Subjects Research. No re-identification was attempted, no linkage with other data sources occurred, and no contact was made with the original posters. 3. 10 Methodological Limitations This work is based entirely on offline text simulations: eighty previously posted student queries were fed to a single model version (GPT-4-0613, accessed 15 July 2024) and analyzed with automated NLP tools. Statistics are therefore descriptive flags, not confirmatory tests, and the behavior of other LLM versions or alternative chatbots may diverge sharply from the patterns reported here. Because no live users or clinicians interacted with the system, the study cannot speak to real-time usability, safety, or conversational dynamics. A second limitation concerns external validity and measurement. Warmth, empathy, and acceptance were inferred by machine-learning models rather than by human raters, while crucial clinical outcomes, such as symptom change or client satisfaction, were not observed. Consequently, the present findings should be read as an exploratory, hypothesis-generating snapshot rather than evidence of effectiveness; rigorous user studies, multi-model replications and mixed-methods validation remain essential before any real-world deployment of ChatGPT in psychological counseling. A third limitation is the lack of direct input from the relevant people this technology is meant to serve.

The application of GPT in the field of psychological counseling shows significant promise, primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the responses generated. Most GPT outputs are empathetic and supportive, which are critical attributes in therapeutic settings. Positive interactions in therapy are known to enhance client engagement and satisfaction, thereby contributing to more effective therapeutic alliances and outcomes. However, it is important to acknowledge that GPT also produces non-positive and even confusing responses in certain instances, indicating some issues with the stability and reliability of its outputs."}], "retrieved": [{"id": 1313, "text": ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 1.

Outliers—chiefly “confusion” labels and larger sentiment swings—were infrequent but present, providing quantitative entry-points for the discussion that follows. The application of GPT in the field of psychological counseling shows significant promise, primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the responses generated. Most GPT outputs are empathetic and supportive, which are critical attributes in therapeutic settings. Positive interactions in therapy are known to enhance client engagement and satisfaction, thereby contributing to more effective therapeutic alliances and outcomes.

Introduction | Page 2\n1. Introduction Math anxiety is characterised by feelings of apprehension and heightened physiological responses when individuals encounter math-related situations (Hembree, 1990; Richardson and Suinn, 1972). This includes exposure to evaluative contexts involving mathematical ability (e. g. taking a math exam), the need to handle numbers in everyday scenarios (e. g. splitting bills), and the passive observation of math-related activities (e. g. watching someone solve a problem Hunt et al. (2011)). Although suffering from math anxiety may not meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) for an anxiety disorder, evidence shows that individuals who suffer from math anxiety experience a significant impairment in their well-being, as well as in their academic success (Ashcraft, 2002; Wu et al., 2014; Chang and Beilock, 2016; Gabriel et al., 2020; Caviola et al., 2022). Furthermore, math anxiety should be distinguished from anxiety related to other STEM (Science, Technological, En- gineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Paechter et al., 2017), or from general test anxiety (Zeidner, 2007; Cassady and Johnson, 2002). Math anxiety manifests in both cognitive and emotional dimensions: individuals ex- perience impairment in working memory (Beilock et al., 2007; Macher et al., 2012), and report feelings of considerable tension and worry. Reducing the maximum load of working memory means that math anxiety can drastically reduce the ability for individuals to load and manipulate symbols, competencies and knowledge, negatively impacting their math performance (Stella, 2022). Besides this, as a consequence of math anxiety, individuals adopt safety-seeking behaviours, such as actions that could help them avoid feared stimuli or outcomes (Cuming et al., 2009; Gangemi et al., 2012). Since its early days (Mowrer, 1960), psychology has defined avoidance as a behavioural response to external stimuli that produce fear and anxiety, aimed at reducing the experience of fear through negative reinforcement, which can be intrinsically rewarding. Internal stimuli, such as thoughts and emotions, contribute to a prolonged anxious response that prevents the extinction of the anxiety and reinforces the emotion itself (Hayes et al., 1996). Although this principle originates from research on general anxiety disorders, it is also relevant to math anxiety. In the context of math anxiety, avoidance behaviour manifests as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, which prevents cognitive reprocessing and deepening of mathematical understanding. By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen, extend, and nuance their mathematical concepts through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). However, when anxiety leads an individual to experiential avoidance, preventing con- stant exposure to anxiety-inducing information, mental representations remain static, hindering the development of cognitive complexity (i. e. the creation of fewer associations with the target of avoidance) and strengthening the negative emotional aspect (i. e. to perceiving the target of avoidance as more negative than it is). This triggers various cognitive biases, common in both individuals who suffer from anxiety and those who do not (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). For example, the \"behaviour as information\" bias leads individuals to believe that \"If I avoid, then there is a danger\", prompting safety-seeking behaviours that hinder further exposure to the feared stimulus, and create a cascading effect (Gangemi et al., 2012). Another type of bias is emotional reasoning, through which individuals tend to use their emotions as significant information about external events, even when the emotion is not generated by the situation being evaluated (Arntz et al., 1995; Gangemi et al., 2012). Math anxiety can also be transmitted and reinforce gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by the work of Beilock et al. (2010), which highlighted that 2 female teachers’ math anxiety can reinforce gender stereotypes in female students, but not in male students. Nowadays, experiential avoidance (Hayes et al., 1996) is the primary target of standard interventions for anxiety disorders, and it is considered both a vulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014). Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019).\n\nQuestion: What methods can provide a deeper understanding of students' thought processes in math anxiety?\nAnswer:", "contexts": ["[1] Section: 1.

This, in turn, hinders the development of cognitive complexity and strengthens negative emotional associations (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen their mathematical understanding through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). According to Hayes et al. (1996), experiential avoidance is the primary target in interventions for anxiety disorders and can be both a vulnerability and maintenance factor. This principle also applies to math anxiety, where avoidance behaviors, such as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, prevent cognitive reprocessing and deepen negative emotional responses toward math.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hayes, S.

Introduction | Page 2\n1. Introduction Math anxiety is characterised by feelings of apprehension and heightened physiological responses when individuals encounter math-related situations (Hembree, 1990; Richardson and Suinn, 1972). This includes exposure to evaluative contexts involving mathematical ability (e. g. taking a math exam), the need to handle numbers in everyday scenarios (e. g. splitting bills), and the passive observation of math-related activities (e. g. watching someone solve a problem Hunt et al. (2011)). Although suffering from math anxiety may not meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) for an anxiety disorder, evidence shows that individuals who suffer from math anxiety experience a significant impairment in their well-being, as well as in their academic success (Ashcraft, 2002; Wu et al., 2014; Chang and Beilock, 2016; Gabriel et al., 2020; Caviola et al., 2022). Furthermore, math anxiety should be distinguished from anxiety related to other STEM (Science, Technological, En- gineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Paechter et al., 2017), or from general test anxiety (Zeidner, 2007; Cassady and Johnson, 2002). Math anxiety manifests in both cognitive and emotional dimensions: individuals ex- perience impairment in working memory (Beilock et al., 2007; Macher et al., 2012), and report feelings of considerable tension and worry. Reducing the maximum load of working memory means that math anxiety can drastically reduce the ability for individuals to load and manipulate symbols, competencies and knowledge, negatively impacting their math performance (Stella, 2022). Besides this, as a consequence of math anxiety, individuals adopt safety-seeking behaviours, such as actions that could help them avoid feared stimuli or outcomes (Cuming et al., 2009; Gangemi et al., 2012). Since its early days (Mowrer, 1960), psychology has defined avoidance as a behavioural response to external stimuli that produce fear and anxiety, aimed at reducing the experience of fear through negative reinforcement, which can be intrinsically rewarding. Internal stimuli, such as thoughts and emotions, contribute to a prolonged anxious response that prevents the extinction of the anxiety and reinforces the emotion itself (Hayes et al., 1996). Although this principle originates from research on general anxiety disorders, it is also relevant to math anxiety. In the context of math anxiety, avoidance behaviour manifests as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, which prevents cognitive reprocessing and deepening of mathematical understanding. By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen, extend, and nuance their mathematical concepts through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). However, when anxiety leads an individual to experiential avoidance, preventing con- stant exposure to anxiety-inducing information, mental representations remain static, hindering the development of cognitive complexity (i. e. the creation of fewer associations with the target of avoidance) and strengthening the negative emotional aspect (i. e. to perceiving the target of avoidance as more negative than it is). This triggers various cognitive biases, common in both individuals who suffer from anxiety and those who do not (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). For example, the \"behaviour as information\" bias leads individuals to believe that \"If I avoid, then there is a danger\", prompting safety-seeking behaviours that hinder further exposure to the feared stimulus, and create a cascading effect (Gangemi et al., 2012). Another type of bias is emotional reasoning, through which individuals tend to use their emotions as significant information about external events, even when the emotion is not generated by the situation being evaluated (Arntz et al., 1995; Gangemi et al., 2012). Math anxiety can also be transmitted and reinforce gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by the work of Beilock et al. (2010), which highlighted that 2 female teachers’ math anxiety can reinforce gender stereotypes in female students, but not in male students. Nowadays, experiential avoidance (Hayes et al., 1996) is the primary target of standard interventions for anxiety disorders, and it is considered both a vulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014).

Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019). A key aspect of the mental lexicon is associative knowledge, a cognitive subsystem that interfaces with semantic and autobiographical memory, mapping similarities between conceptual repre- sentations, and driving recall, as well as the processing of conceptual information (Collins and Loftus, 1975; Laiacona et al., 1993; Stella et al., 2024). Numerous cognitive processes, such as word learning (Hills et al., 2009; Stella et al., 2017), creativity (Kenett and Faust, 2019; Stella and Kenett, 2019), and domain-specific competence levels (Tyumeneva et al., 2017; Siew, 2020), among many others, can all be investigated by representing associative knowledge as a network of concepts. Networks of concepts can then be further analysed quantitatively using graph theory and network analytical techniques (Siew et al., 2019b). Behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs) are complex networks modelling how individuals structure their associative knowledge about the external world (Stella and Kenett, 2019; Stella and Zaytseva, 2020). BFMNs owe their name to their nature as proxies of someone’s mindset (Smeets et al. (2006); \"forma mentis\" stands for mindset in Latin), captured in terms of associating ideas/concepts and attributing valence to them. The strength of BFMNs lies in their ability to represent knowledge structures via mem- ory recall patterns, also known as free associations (De Deyne et al., 2013), and going beyond the necessity of defining specific associative constraints. Free associations can be represented as multidimensional links of memory recall patterns between ideas, combin- ing semantic, syntactic, phonological, but also visual, experiential or simply co-occurring features of conceptual associations in someone’s cognitive memory (Citraro et al., 2023). BFMNs use free associations to structure how individuals’ or groups’ associative knowl- edge is shaped around key target ideas (e. g. cues that elicit someone’s memory and start the creation of links between cues and responses). On top of this cognitive dimension, BFMNs also encapsulate an affective perspective, according to whether individuals/groups perceive their recalled ideas positively, negatively or neutrally valenced. Consequently, af- fective perceptions in terms of conceptual valence can alter the quality of free association structures of conceptual associations. For example, positive concepts might tend to link with each other, while a negative concept might be contrasted with other positive ideas. BFMNs have been used in the past to assess negative attitudes towards science among high school students and researchers (Stella and Kenett, 2019), and can also be employed at different times to assess changes in individual or group-level mindsets over time (Stella and Zaytseva, 2020). BFMNs have also been applied in the emerging field of machine psychology (i. e. a field lying at the intersection of psychology and computer science) to investigate the mindsets of Large Language Models (LLMs; Abramski et al.

Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019). A key aspect of the mental lexicon is associative knowledge, a cognitive subsystem that interfaces with semantic and autobiographical memory, mapping similarities between conceptual repre- sentations, and driving recall, as well as the processing of conceptual information (Collins and Loftus, 1975; Laiacona et al., 1993; Stella et al., 2024). Numerous cognitive processes, such as word learning (Hills et al., 2009; Stella et al., 2017), creativity (Kenett and Faust, 2019; Stella and Kenett, 2019), and domain-specific competence levels (Tyumeneva et al., 2017; Siew, 2020), among many others, can all be investigated by representing associative knowledge as a network of concepts. Networks of concepts can then be further analysed quantitatively using graph theory and network analytical techniques (Siew et al., 2019b). Behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs) are complex networks modelling how individuals structure their associative knowledge about the external world (Stella and Kenett, 2019; Stella and Zaytseva, 2020). BFMNs owe their name to their nature as proxies of someone’s mindset (Smeets et al. (2006); \"forma mentis\" stands for mindset in Latin), captured in terms of associating ideas/concepts and attributing valence to them. The strength of BFMNs lies in their ability to represent knowledge structures via mem- ory recall patterns, also known as free associations (De Deyne et al., 2013), and going beyond the necessity of defining specific associative constraints. Free associations can be represented as multidimensional links of memory recall patterns between ideas, combin- ing semantic, syntactic, phonological, but also visual, experiential or simply co-occurring features of conceptual associations in someone’s cognitive memory (Citraro et al., 2023). BFMNs use free associations to structure how individuals’ or groups’ associative knowl- edge is shaped around key target ideas (e. g. cues that elicit someone’s memory and start the creation of links between cues and responses). On top of this cognitive dimension, BFMNs also encapsulate an affective perspective, according to whether individuals/groups perceive their recalled ideas positively, negatively or neutrally valenced. Consequently, af- fective perceptions in terms of conceptual valence can alter the quality of free association structures of conceptual associations. For example, positive concepts might tend to link with each other, while a negative concept might be contrasted with other positive ideas. BFMNs have been used in the past to assess negative attitudes towards science among high school students and researchers (Stella and Kenett, 2019), and can also be employed at different times to assess changes in individual or group-level mindsets over time (Stella and Zaytseva, 2020). BFMNs have also been applied in the emerging field of machine psychology (i. e. a field lying at the intersection of psychology and computer science) to investigate the mindsets of Large Language Models (LLMs; Abramski et al. (2023)).

Introduction Math anxiety is characterised by feelings of apprehension and heightened physiological responses when individuals encounter math-related situations (Hembree, 1990; Richardson and Suinn, 1972). This includes exposure to evaluative contexts involving mathematical ability (e. g. taking a math exam), the need to handle numbers in everyday scenarios (e. g. splitting bills), and the passive observation of math-related activities (e. g. watching someone solve a problem Hunt et al. (2011)). Although suffering from math anxiety may not meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) for an anxiety disorder, evidence shows that individuals who suffer from math anxiety experience a significant impairment in their well-being, as well as in their academic success (Ashcraft, 2002; Wu et al., 2014; Chang and Beilock, 2016; Gabriel et al., 2020; Caviola et al., 2022). Furthermore, math anxiety should be distinguished from anxiety related to other STEM (Science, Technological, En- gineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Paechter et al., 2017), or from general test anxiety (Zeidner, 2007; Cassady and Johnson, 2002). Math anxiety manifests in both cognitive and emotional dimensions: individuals ex- perience impairment in working memory (Beilock et al., 2007; Macher et al., 2012), and report feelings of considerable tension and worry. Reducing the maximum load of working memory means that math anxiety can drastically reduce the ability for individuals to load and manipulate symbols, competencies and knowledge, negatively impacting their math performance (Stella, 2022). Besides this, as a consequence of math anxiety, individuals adopt safety-seeking behaviours, such as actions that could help them avoid feared stimuli or outcomes (Cuming et al., 2009; Gangemi et al., 2012). Since its early days (Mowrer, 1960), psychology has defined avoidance as a behavioural response to external stimuli that produce fear and anxiety, aimed at reducing the experience of fear through negative reinforcement, which can be intrinsically rewarding. Internal stimuli, such as thoughts and emotions, contribute to a prolonged anxious response that prevents the extinction of the anxiety and reinforces the emotion itself (Hayes et al., 1996). Although this principle originates from research on general anxiety disorders, it is also relevant to math anxiety. In the context of math anxiety, avoidance behaviour manifests as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, which prevents cognitive reprocessing and deepening of mathematical understanding. By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen, extend, and nuance their mathematical concepts through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). However, when anxiety leads an individual to experiential avoidance, preventing con- stant exposure to anxiety-inducing information, mental representations remain static, hindering the development of cognitive complexity (i. e. the creation of fewer associations with the target of avoidance) and strengthening the negative emotional aspect (i. e. to perceiving the target of avoidance as more negative than it is). This triggers various cognitive biases, common in both individuals who suffer from anxiety and those who do not (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). For example, the \"behaviour as information\" bias leads individuals to believe that \"If I avoid, then there is a danger\", prompting safety-seeking behaviours that hinder further exposure to the feared stimulus, and create a cascading effect (Gangemi et al., 2012). Another type of bias is emotional reasoning, through which individuals tend to use their emotions as significant information about external events, even when the emotion is not generated by the situation being evaluated (Arntz et al., 1995; Gangemi et al., 2012). Math anxiety can also be transmitted and reinforce gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by the work of Beilock et al. (2010), which highlighted that 2 female teachers’ math anxiety can reinforce gender stereotypes in female students, but not in male students. Nowadays, experiential avoidance (Hayes et al., 1996) is the primary target of standard interventions for anxiety disorders, and it is considered both a vulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014). Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning?

This is supported by Chang and Beilock (2016), who further elucidated how math anxiety disrupts working memory and increases avoidance behaviour in math-related tasks. Additionally, Caviola et al. (2022) provided insights into how math anxiety affects students’ performance and attitudes, finding that high levels of math anxiety are associ- ated with poorer performance and more negative associations with mathematical tasks. Their work underscores the need to explore how these negative associations are formed and maintained within cognitive networks. While these studies have significantly advanced our understanding of math anxiety and its consequences, there remains a need for further exploration into how cognitive networks, specifically related to math, are influenced by varying levels of anxiety. This experiment aims to investigate the characteristics of cognitive networks in a sample of un- dergraduate psychology students by exploring how perceptions and associations related to math vary in relation to levels of math anxiety. By employing a free association task to map cognitive networks, this research uncovers individual and group differences in the perception and association of mathematical ideas. The goal is to deepen our under- standing of the psychological mechanisms underlying math anxiety and its cognitive and emotional implications, thereby contributing valuable insights into the interplay between anxiety, cognition, and academic performance. 3. 2. Participants and Materials 75 undergraduate students from the Department of Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Trento (Italy) were recruited through convenience sampling using the department’s social media channels and word of mouth. All participants were adults and native Italian speakers. The protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia (ID: 205244) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants signed an informed consent and did not receive any compensation for their participation. We cleaned the data, removing all the participants who did not provide any associa- tions for the cue words \"math\" and \"anxiety\", which were fundamental for the network analysis. We also excluded participants with more than 1/3 of the data missing. In the end, only 70 participants out of the initial 75 were considered for the analysis. Each participant followed the procedure described in the Methods Section. In partic- ular, for Experiment 1, we selected 40 words as stimuli (i. e. cue words), which can be clustered into 4 groups, consisting of words related to: 1. STEM and Academic Disciplines 2. Psychology and Mental Health 3. Academic Evaluation 4. Personal Attitude The 40 cue words of the current experiment are reported in Table A. 1. As for the analyses performed to obtain the results of Experiment 1, we refer to the Analysis Section. 3. 3. Results In Table 2 we report the statistics of the main network features described in Section Behavioural forma mentis networks. There we see that the degree of \"math\" had a mean of 6. 53 (SD = 1. 21), while the degree of \"anxiety\" had a mean of 6. 29 (SD = 8", "[3] Section: 2. Methods | Page 5\n2. Methods 2. 1. Materials The first three experiments share the same methodology in terms of analysis and procedure, while they differ in the participant sample and materials used. In all the participant samples, each participant (either human or GPT-simulated) had to perform the following tasks: • Completion of the MAS-IT questionnaire. The Mathematics Anxiety Scale–IT is the Italian translated scale of the MAS-UK questionnaire (Hunt et al., 2011) and has been validated in an Italian undergraduate population to assess math anxiety (Franchino et al., 2025). The factors originally identified by the MAS-UK, which are considered in the current study, are the following: 1. Evaluation MA (Math Anxiety), which encompasses anxiety associated with the evaluation of mathematical ability, often in formal academic settings (e. g. taking a math exam, answering a question in front of a class). 2. Everyday/Social MA, which includes anxiety experienced in everyday situa- tions involving math, often with social implications (e. g. calculating change, splitting bills, remembering phone numbers). 3. Passive Observation MA, which refers to anxiety triggered by the passive obser- vation of math-related activities, even without direct participation (e. g. watch- ing someone solve a problem, listening to a math class) (Hunt et al., 2011). Participants were asked to rate their anxiety level on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (\"not anxious at all\") to 5 (\"very anxious\"), facilitating a comprehensive, yet approximate quantification of math anxiety levels as expressed by individuals. All the original and translated items of the MAS questionnaire can be found in Table A. 3. • Performance of a free association task. Different cue words were selected as stimuli, to which participants had to associate the first three words that came to their mind when reading them. Participants were instructed to perform the free association task as quickly as possible to preserve the spontaneity and effectiveness of the free association method (De Deyne et al., 2013). For the same reason, if a participant was unable to provide one or more associations, they were allowed to leave those responses blank. • Valence attribution task. For all the words provided in the free association task and the cue words (i. e. if a participant did not leave any association blank, the total was of 160 words), participants had to rate their emotional valence, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (\"very negative\") to 5 (\"very positive\"), with neutrality being represented by a score of 3. For this task, no timing instruction was given. For the human participant samples, each participant sat in front of a computer, where they were first asked to complete an informed consent form outlining key information about privacy and data protection. The entire experiment lasted approximately 40 minutes. As for the GPT simulated students, the model was prompted to impersonate an under- graduate psychology student, and consequently, it generated the answers to the different tasks, coherently with its personification. All the details of this process will be described in Section Methods. 5", "[4] Section: 3.3.1. Correlations Analysis | Page 9\n1. 91), meaning that both \"math\" and \"anxiety\" are strongly connected to other words in students’ BFMNs. The slightly higher degree for \"math\" suggests that it is linked to a wider range of concepts, while the strong connections to \"anxiety\" may reflect how emotionally important or present it is in students’ minds. The closeness centrality of the word \"math\" had a mean of 0. 09 (SD = 0. 05), while the closeness centrality of the word \"anxiety\" had a mean of 0. 08 (SD = 0. 06) (cf. Table 2). Both \"math\" and \"anxiety\" are equally central within the students’ BFMNs, meaning that these two concepts were just as easily reachable from other ideas in the network, reflecting their overall importance or accessibility in students’ thinking. Furthermore, in Table 3, one can find the descriptive statistics of the three math anxiety factors and the total math anxiety. 3. 3. 1. Correlations Analysis The correlograms in Figure 1 examine the interrelationships among the math anxiety and network measures. Bivariate relationships between variables were inspected through zero-order Pearson’s correlations, with significance level fixed to α = . 05 (N = 70). Look- Figure 1: Correlogram Experiment 1. The valence, degree and closeness centrality (CC) for the nodes \"anxiety\" and \"math\" are reported, along with the factors of MA: Evaluation, Everyday/Social (Social) and Passive Observation (Observation), together with the Total MA. ing at Figure 1, one can observe a persistent trend in the significant correlations that were found for each math anxiety factor and its totality.

This experiment aims to investigate the characteristics of cognitive networks in a sample of un- dergraduate psychology students by exploring how perceptions and associations related to math vary in relation to levels of math anxiety. By employing a free association task to map cognitive networks, this research uncovers individual and group differences in the perception and association of mathematical ideas. The goal is to deepen our under- standing of the psychological mechanisms underlying math anxiety and its cognitive and emotional implications, thereby contributing valuable insights into the interplay between anxiety, cognition, and academic performance. 3. 2. Participants and Materials 75 undergraduate students from the Department of Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Trento (Italy) were recruited through convenience sampling using the department’s social media channels and word of mouth. All participants were adults and native Italian speakers. The protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia (ID: 205244) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants signed an informed consent and did not receive any compensation for their participation. We cleaned the data, removing all the participants who did not provide any associa- tions for the cue words \"math\" and \"anxiety\", which were fundamental for the network analysis. We also excluded participants with more than 1/3 of the data missing. In the end, only 70 participants out of the initial 75 were considered for the analysis. Each participant followed the procedure described in the Methods Section. In partic- ular, for Experiment 1, we selected 40 words as stimuli (i. e. cue words), which can be clustered into 4 groups, consisting of words related to: 1. STEM and Academic Disciplines 2. Psychology and Mental Health 3. Academic Evaluation 4. Personal Attitude The 40 cue words of the current experiment are reported in Table A. 1. As for the analyses performed to obtain the results of Experiment 1, we refer to the Analysis Section. 3. 3. Results In Table 2 we report the statistics of the main network features described in Section Behavioural forma mentis networks.

Materials The first three experiments share the same methodology in terms of analysis and procedure, while they differ in the participant sample and materials used. In all the participant samples, each participant (either human or GPT-simulated) had to perform the following tasks: • Completion of the MAS-IT questionnaire. The Mathematics Anxiety Scale–IT is the Italian translated scale of the MAS-UK questionnaire (Hunt et al., 2011) and has been validated in an Italian undergraduate population to assess math anxiety (Franchino et al., 2025). The factors originally identified by the MAS-UK, which are considered in the current study, are the following: 1. Evaluation MA (Math Anxiety), which encompasses anxiety associated with the evaluation of mathematical ability, often in formal academic settings (e. g. taking a math exam, answering a question in front of a class). 2. Everyday/Social MA, which includes anxiety experienced in everyday situa- tions involving math, often with social implications (e. g. calculating change, splitting bills, remembering phone numbers). 3. Passive Observation MA, which refers to anxiety triggered by the passive obser- vation of math-related activities, even without direct participation (e. g. watch- ing someone solve a problem, listening to a math class) (Hunt et al., 2011). Participants were asked to rate their anxiety level on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (\"not anxious at all\") to 5 (\"very anxious\"), facilitating a comprehensive, yet approximate quantification of math anxiety levels as expressed by individuals. All the original and translated items of the MAS questionnaire can be found in Table A. 3. • Performance of a free association task. Different cue words were selected as stimuli, to which participants had to associate the first three words that came to their mind when reading them. Participants were instructed to perform the free association task as quickly as possible to preserve the spontaneity and effectiveness of the free association method (De Deyne et al., 2013). For the same reason, if a participant was unable to provide one or more associations, they were allowed to leave those responses blank. • Valence attribution task. For all the words provided in the free association task and the cue words (i. e. if a participant did not leave any association blank, the total was of 160 words), participants had to rate their emotional valence, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (\"very negative\") to 5 (\"very positive\"), with neutrality being represented by a score of 3. For this task, no timing instruction was given. For the human participant samples, each participant sat in front of a computer, where they were first asked to complete an informed consent form outlining key information about privacy and data protection. The entire experiment lasted approximately 40 minutes. As for the GPT simulated students, the model was prompted to impersonate an under- graduate psychology student, and consequently, it generated the answers to the different tasks, coherently with its personification.

Introduction Math anxiety is characterised by feelings of apprehension and heightened physiological responses when individuals encounter math-related situations (Hembree, 1990; Richardson and Suinn, 1972). This includes exposure to evaluative contexts involving mathematical ability (e. g. taking a math exam), the need to handle numbers in everyday scenarios (e. g. splitting bills), and the passive observation of math-related activities (e. g. watching someone solve a problem Hunt et al. (2011)). Although suffering from math anxiety may not meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) for an anxiety disorder, evidence shows that individuals who suffer from math anxiety experience a significant impairment in their well-being, as well as in their academic success (Ashcraft, 2002; Wu et al., 2014; Chang and Beilock, 2016; Gabriel et al., 2020; Caviola et al., 2022). Furthermore, math anxiety should be distinguished from anxiety related to other STEM (Science, Technological, En- gineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Paechter et al., 2017), or from general test anxiety (Zeidner, 2007; Cassady and Johnson, 2002). Math anxiety manifests in both cognitive and emotional dimensions: individuals ex- perience impairment in working memory (Beilock et al., 2007; Macher et al., 2012), and report feelings of considerable tension and worry. Reducing the maximum load of working memory means that math anxiety can drastically reduce the ability for individuals to load and manipulate symbols, competencies and knowledge, negatively impacting their math performance (Stella, 2022). Besides this, as a consequence of math anxiety, individuals adopt safety-seeking behaviours, such as actions that could help them avoid feared stimuli or outcomes (Cuming et al., 2009; Gangemi et al., 2012). Since its early days (Mowrer, 1960), psychology has defined avoidance as a behavioural response to external stimuli that produce fear and anxiety, aimed at reducing the experience of fear through negative reinforcement, which can be intrinsically rewarding. Internal stimuli, such as thoughts and emotions, contribute to a prolonged anxious response that prevents the extinction of the anxiety and reinforces the emotion itself (Hayes et al., 1996). Although this principle originates from research on general anxiety disorders, it is also relevant to math anxiety. In the context of math anxiety, avoidance behaviour manifests as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, which prevents cognitive reprocessing and deepening of mathematical understanding. By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen, extend, and nuance their mathematical concepts through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). However, when anxiety leads an individual to experiential avoidance, preventing con- stant exposure to anxiety-inducing information, mental representations remain static, hindering the development of cognitive complexity (i. e. the creation of fewer associations with the target of avoidance) and strengthening the negative emotional aspect (i. e. to perceiving the target of avoidance as more negative than it is). This triggers various cognitive biases, common in both individuals who suffer from anxiety and those who do not (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). For example, the \"behaviour as information\" bias leads individuals to believe that \"If I avoid, then there is a danger\", prompting safety-seeking behaviours that hinder further exposure to the feared stimulus, and create a cascading effect (Gangemi et al., 2012). Another type of bias is emotional reasoning, through which individuals tend to use their emotions as significant information about external events, even when the emotion is not generated by the situation being evaluated (Arntz et al., 1995; Gangemi et al., 2012). Math anxiety can also be transmitted and reinforce gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by the work of Beilock et al. (2010), which highlighted that 2 female teachers’ math anxiety can reinforce gender stereotypes in female students, but not in male students. Nowadays, experiential avoidance (Hayes et al., 1996) is the primary target of standard interventions for anxiety disorders, and it is considered both a vulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014). Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019).", "source_path": "/Users/gscm/Documents/GitHub/beyond-the-cutoff/data/processed/cog_psych_2025_run01/papers/2511.01558.txt", "page": 2, "section_title": "1.

Introduction | Page 2\n1. Introduction Math anxiety is characterised by feelings of apprehension and heightened physiological responses when individuals encounter math-related situations (Hembree, 1990; Richardson and Suinn, 1972). This includes exposure to evaluative contexts involving mathematical ability (e. g. taking a math exam), the need to handle numbers in everyday scenarios (e. g. splitting bills), and the passive observation of math-related activities (e. g. watching someone solve a problem Hunt et al. (2011)). Although suffering from math anxiety may not meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) for an anxiety disorder, evidence shows that individuals who suffer from math anxiety experience a significant impairment in their well-being, as well as in their academic success (Ashcraft, 2002; Wu et al., 2014; Chang and Beilock, 2016; Gabriel et al., 2020; Caviola et al., 2022). Furthermore, math anxiety should be distinguished from anxiety related to other STEM (Science, Technological, En- gineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Paechter et al., 2017), or from general test anxiety (Zeidner, 2007; Cassady and Johnson, 2002). Math anxiety manifests in both cognitive and emotional dimensions: individuals ex- perience impairment in working memory (Beilock et al., 2007; Macher et al., 2012), and report feelings of considerable tension and worry. Reducing the maximum load of working memory means that math anxiety can drastically reduce the ability for individuals to load and manipulate symbols, competencies and knowledge, negatively impacting their math performance (Stella, 2022). Besides this, as a consequence of math anxiety, individuals adopt safety-seeking behaviours, such as actions that could help them avoid feared stimuli or outcomes (Cuming et al., 2009; Gangemi et al., 2012). Since its early days (Mowrer, 1960), psychology has defined avoidance as a behavioural response to external stimuli that produce fear and anxiety, aimed at reducing the experience of fear through negative reinforcement, which can be intrinsically rewarding. Internal stimuli, such as thoughts and emotions, contribute to a prolonged anxious response that prevents the extinction of the anxiety and reinforces the emotion itself (Hayes et al., 1996). Although this principle originates from research on general anxiety disorders, it is also relevant to math anxiety. In the context of math anxiety, avoidance behaviour manifests as a reluctance to engage with math tasks, which prevents cognitive reprocessing and deepening of mathematical understanding. By avoiding math-related tasks, students fail to strengthen, extend, and nuance their mathematical concepts through continuous processing, leading to a cycle of avoidance that hinders their mathematical development (Hembree, 1990). However, when anxiety leads an individual to experiential avoidance, preventing con- stant exposure to anxiety-inducing information, mental representations remain static, hindering the development of cognitive complexity (i. e. the creation of fewer associations with the target of avoidance) and strengthening the negative emotional aspect (i. e. to perceiving the target of avoidance as more negative than it is). This triggers various cognitive biases, common in both individuals who suffer from anxiety and those who do not (Van Den Hout et al., 2014). For example, the \"behaviour as information\" bias leads individuals to believe that \"If I avoid, then there is a danger\", prompting safety-seeking behaviours that hinder further exposure to the feared stimulus, and create a cascading effect (Gangemi et al., 2012). Another type of bias is emotional reasoning, through which individuals tend to use their emotions as significant information about external events, even when the emotion is not generated by the situation being evaluated (Arntz et al., 1995; Gangemi et al., 2012). Math anxiety can also be transmitted and reinforce gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by the work of Beilock et al. (2010), which highlighted that 2 female teachers’ math anxiety can reinforce gender stereotypes in female students, but not in male students. Nowadays, experiential avoidance (Hayes et al., 1996) is the primary target of standard interventions for anxiety disorders, and it is considered both a vulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014). Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019).\n\nQuestion: Identify the source of the information on how experiential avoidance contributes to math anxiety.\nAnswer:", "contexts": ["[1] Section: 1.
