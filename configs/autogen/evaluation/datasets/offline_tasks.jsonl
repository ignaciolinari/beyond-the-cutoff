This study provides new perspectives for understanding the complex interactions between manufacturers and platforms in smart product supply chains, and offers theoretical support and practical guidance for actual business decisions.

Since the marginal utility that the consumer obtains from the innovation of a smart product is 𝛽 , when the manufacturer is overconfident, it believes that the utility that the consumer obtains for product innovation is 𝛽𝑜= 𝛽+ ε. utility from smart product innovations is 𝛽, when the manufacturer is overconfident, where 𝛽0 belongs to a random variable with mean 𝜇+ ε and variance 𝜎2. In this case, we still analyze the equilibrium decisions made by the manufacturer and the platform in both cases of usage-based contracts and revenue-sharing contracts.

Under this revenue-sharing contract, Huawei, as a manufacturer, shows moderate overconfidence and continues to invest in hardware innovations (e. g. , multi-device collaboration, Hongmeng distributed capabilities) above the industry's rational level in order to promote its \"all-scene smart life\" strategy. When the platform share is high, developers' software innovation increases and then decreases with Huawei's level of confidence: initially, they are willing to adapt to the Hongmeng system, but as Huawei's pricing strategy becomes more aggressive (e. g. , high-end folded-screen positioning), some developers turn conservative to avoid demand risks. When Huawei increased the developer share through the \"Star Program\", developers' level of software innovation increased monotonically with Huawei's confidence level due to increased revenue security, and they were more active in developing native apps and deepening system integration. In the end, within the moderate confidence interval, both sides through hardware innovation to drive demand, software synergies to enhance the viscosity of the way, to achieve profits are higher than the level of the fully rational scenario. 5.

First, the study treats certain variables as fixed parameters, while in reality they may present dynamic characteristics over time and environmental changes, which may lead to an underestimation of the actual impact. Second, the study assumes that the proportion of non-privacy-sensitive customers is static, and does not fully consider the dynamic impact of privacy policies, technological development and other factors on customer behavior. Finally, in terms of contract design, the study does not deeply explore the dynamic adjustment and enforcement of contract terms, which may limit the applicability of the model in practical applications. Future research can construct a dynamic game model to further delve into the dynamics of manufacturers' overconfidence and its impact on long-term collaborative innovation in the supply chain, as well as introduce more behavioral economics theories to analyze the interactions of different behavioral traits and their impact on decision-making.

All latent variables are standardized to have mean zero and unit variance. Factor loadings (λi) are estimated freely, with one loading per construct fixed to 1 for identification. The model does not impose directional structural paths among latent variables. Instead, it specifies covariances among the latent constructs to capture their interrelationships. These covariances reflect the hypothesis that the justification of domestic violence, adherence to masculine norms, and household time use are jointly shaped by shared underlying sociocultural factors. I estimate the model using maximum likelihood with robust standard errors.

Effects are: (i) stronger for men than women, suggesting that men’s reports of shared leisure are more influenced by tolerant attitudes; (ii) amplified among individuals aware of domestic violence services or believing in a way out, which may reflect greater recognition of violence without necessarily altering household practices; (iii) weaker or absent among individuals with limited perceived agency, highlighting the interaction between cultural norms and perceived alternatives. These patterns reinforce the idea that attitudes and behaviors are interconnected but mediated by awareness and gendered perceptions. Taken together, the findings provide three main insights: (i) norms outweigh demographics: cultural orientations are the strongest predictors of tolerance, not education, gender, or employment; (ii) partner characteristics matter: women’s tolerance is shaped by men’s education, caregiving role assignments, and normative orientations; (iii) tolerance is linked to more joint leisure: counterintuitively, tolerant households report greater co-presence, suggesting that time together can coexist with hierarchical dynamics.

Individual Attitudes and Time Use Within the Household Elena Pisanelli University of Bergamo, Department of Economics Abstract This paper proposes a novel empirical strategy to measure cultural justifications of domestic violence within households, with direct implications for demographic behavior and gender inequality. Leveraging survey data on individual attitudes and high-frequency time-use diaries from Italian couples with children, I construct a composite index that integrates stated beliefs with observed household practices. Using structural equation modeling, I disentangle latent tolerance of domestic violence from reported attitudes and validate the index against both individual and partner characteristics, as well as time allocation patterns. Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender, education, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms are strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it. Tolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time with partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily reflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining structures. Beyond advancing measurement, the findings highlight how cultural tolerance of domestic violence is embedded in household arrangements that influence fertility, labor supply, and the intergenerational transmission of norms.

Engineering decisions in ML pipelines are rarely neutral: choices such as pre-labeling strategies, class-balancing techniques, or mod- ular architectures can shape not only predictive performance but also auditability, reproducibility, and operational costs. In civic in- frastructures, these trade-offs are amplified by scale, heterogeneous data, and the need for explainable systems that can be audited by non-technical stakeholders. This question investigates the concrete effects of architectural choices—particularly those involving LLM- based automation—on key software engineering attributes such as reliability, traceability, and maintainability. Understanding these effects enables teams to design ML architectures that balance tech- nical efficiency with institutional requirements for accountability and transparency, advancing the broader agenda of responsible AI engineering in the public sector. 4 Methodology This study adopts a retrospective, mixed-methods design [17] to analyze the evolution of the lifecycle of an automated text classi- fication system within the BP context. The goal is to understand how technical and organizational decisions related to automated labeling, architectural evolution, and experiment governance have influenced the system’s reliability, rework, and operational matu- rity. The methodology is structured around five axes: (i) retrospective document analysis, (ii) sample revalidation, (iii) semi-structured interviews, (iv) training and validation, and (v) experiments per- formed. Each axis addresses a co...\n[2] Section: Phase | Page 5\nand minority sets using a threshold of two hundred examples per class and, at inference time, routes each request between two models according to service logic, resulting in multiple passes when necessary. Validation was performed in batch mode on a test file with two thousand proposals, with text in proposal_text and labels in VCGE_N1. The evaluation script iterates over the set in batches, sends requests to the endpoint, and logs for each call the HTTP response code, timestamp, request identifier when available, final label and probability, and the full probability distribution. Each configuration was run ten times with a base seed of forty-two and unit increments per execution, ensuring stable estimates under controlled randomness. Evaluation covered predictive and operational metrics. For pre- dictive quality we computed accuracy, macro precision, macro re- call, and macro F1, both aggregated and per class with support, to reveal tail behaviors. Operationally we measured mean latency and 95th-percentile latency, failure rate, and the average number of inferences per request. In single-classifier variants, inference\n[3] Section: Results | Page 6\nFerreira et al. occurs in a single pass; in the dual-classifier, routing between mod- els can increase the average number of inferences per request and, consequently, the observed latency. 5 Results In this section we provide answers to our research questions. 5. 1 RQ1 — Key technical, organizational, and governance challenges The combination of retrospective document analysis, sample revali- dation, and interviews in the BP context characterizes three vectors that shape the pipeline’s reliability and auditability. The paragraphs below present findings grounded in evidence from the project itself. 5. 1. 1 Technical. Finding T1: Long tail and per-class analysis. The dataset is heavily imbalanced: there are 8,150 examples across 36 classes (mean ≈228 per class), with the largest class containing 1,642 examples, the top three totaling 3,405 (41. 8%), and the three smallest summing to only 23. The largest–smallest ratio is 234:1 and the coefficient of variation is 1. 45. Figure 2 makes this skew clear: the x-axis shows classes C1. . . C36 and the y-axis shows the Count of proposals per class; we mark the mean (𝑢= 285,66) with a dashed line and draw reference lines at 𝑢+ CV · 𝑢and 𝑢−CV · 𝑢 with CV = 1,45 (yielding ≈699,45 and ≈0,00, clamped), along with the annotation “Empirical CV = 1. 45. ” Here, 𝑢is the sample mean of proposals per class and CV = 𝜎/𝑢is the empirical coefficient of variation (standard deviation over the mean). This contrast between the mean and the ±CV ·𝑢band highlights the severe asymmetry of the dataset and motivates evaluating and optimizing performance...\n[4] Section: 200 stratified proposals.

In supervised projects, expert labeling is a bottle- neck that, in BP, was amplified by data volume and by texts that are non-standardized, ambiguous, colloquial, and thematically spe- cific. In this cross-functional setting, the availability of annotators did not always align with the data science team’s demand, which motivated the use of LLMs as a temporary operational solution. The technical implementation consisted of a Python script for batch labeling in a local environment. The corpus contained 10,186 records distributed across 36 classes. The first labeling of the test. csv file was completed on April 24, 2025 [#T11] and recorded in the corresponding commit [#C4]. The labeled set was kept as an opera- tional reference for roughly six months, until October 2025, when we began sample audits to verify consistency and quality [#AE18]. Pre-labeling was performed locally with the gemma3:12b model, processing 8,150 training records and 2,036 test records in approxi- mately 94. 6 minutes; files, logs, and metric tables were versioned to ensure traceability.

Engineering decisions in ML pipelines are rarely neutral: choices such as pre-labeling strategies, class-balancing techniques, or mod- ular architectures can shape not only predictive performance but also auditability, reproducibility, and operational costs. In civic in- frastructures, these trade-offs are amplified by scale, heterogeneous data, and the need for explainable systems that can be audited by non-technical stakeholders. This question investigates the concrete effects of architectural choices—particularly those involving LLM- based automation—on key software engineering attributes such as reliability, traceability, and maintainability. Understanding these effects enables teams to design ML architectures that balance tech- nical efficiency with institutional requirements for accountability and transparency, advancing the broader agenda of responsible AI engineering in the public sector. 4 Methodology This study adopts a retrospective, mixed-methods design [17] to analyze the evolution of the lifecycle of an automated text classi- fication system within the BP context. The goal is to understand how technical and organizational decisions related to automated labeling, architectural evolution, and experiment governance have influenced the system’s reliability, rework, and operational matu- rity.

Introduction | Page 2\nvulner- ability and maintenance factor in models of functioning for a variety of anxiety disorders (Kashdan et al., 2006; Dymond, 2019; Van Den Hout et al., 2014). Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019). A key aspect of the mental lexicon is associative knowledge, a cognitive subsystem that interfaces with semantic and autobiographical memory, mapping similarities between conceptual repre- sentations, and driving recall, as well as the processing of conceptual information (Collins and Loftus, 1975; Laiacona et al., 1993; Stella et al., 2024). Numerous cognitive processes, such as word learning (Hills et al., 2009; Stella et al., 2017), creativity (Kenett and Faust, 2019; Stella and Kenett, 2019), and domain-specific competence levels (Tyumeneva et al., 2017; Siew, 2020), among many others, can all be investigated by representing associative knowledge as a network of concepts. Networks of concepts can then be further analysed quantitatively using graph theory and network analytical techniques (Siew et al., 2019b). Be...\n[2] Section: 2.2. Analysis | Page 6\n2. 2. Analysis 2. 2. 1. Behavioural forma mentis networks Network construction. Each participant read cues, provided responses and rated, in terms of valence, both cues and responses. The resulting data, encapsulated in a data frame, was used to build a BFMN for each participant. Links were built between cues and responses (responses were not linked to each other), following the past protocol established by Stella and Kenett (2019), and inspired by past works with free association data (De Deyne et al., 2013). Links were built as undirected, indicating a memory recall event involving both the cue and the response in the same way. Numerical valence ratings were transformed into categorical \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"neutral\" valence labels (corresponding respectively to the values: 1, -1 and 0) according to the protocol on individual-level BFMNs established by Stella and Zaytseva (2020). For each participant, the lower (Q1) and upper (Q3) quartiles were computed on the distri- bution of all valence ratings attributed to cues and responses. Concepts possessing more than one rating (i. e. responses being repeated twice or more) were attributed a median rating. Concepts with a rating strictly lower than Q1 or equal to the minimum value in the data were assigned a negative valence label. Concepts with a rating strictly higher than Q3 or equal to the maximum value in the data were assigned a positive valence label. A neutral valence label was assigned to the remaining concepts. This approach extracted valence labels, adapting to individuals’ affective biases; e. g. an individ...\n[3] Section: 4. Experiment 2 | Page 11\nAdditionally, the emotional valence of \"anxiety\" contributed uniquely to Passive Ob- servation MA, highlighting how affective perceptions influence more passive or observa- tional facets of math-related anxiety. Interestingly, the network features of \"math\" itself, including its degree and valence, did not significantly relate to math anxiety in this sam- ple. This absence of association could suggest either a general conceptual distancing from \"math\" or that the emotional meaning of anxiety plays a more central role in shaping math anxiety than the semantic richness of \"math\". Overall, these findings suggest that math anxiety is rooted not only in emotional responses to mathematics but also in the affective and structural organisation of seman- tic memory. A more interconnected and negatively valenced representation of \"anxiety\" appears to mirror stronger math-related fears, consistent with mechanisms such as ru- mination, which depletes working memory and heightens math anxiety (LeFevre et al., 2005; Stella, 2022). This aligns with evidence that the semantic richness of negative con- cepts sustains maladaptive emotional states and that emotional reasoning—concluding affect rather than logic (Gangemi et al., 2021)—may reinforce the negative encoding of math-related experiences. 4. Experiment 2 4. 1. Introduction In this experiment, the same paradigm as in Experiment 1 was employed. Therefore, cue words and free associations were evaluated with affective valence scores to investigate associative memory of concepts relative to STEM subjects and math anxiety.

For what concerns \"anxiety\", we found significant correlations between its degree and Total (r = . 13, p < . 05), Evaluation (r = . 13, p < . 05) and Everyday/Social (r = . 12, p < . 05) MA; as well as with its closeness centrality and all the dimensions of MA (Total MA: r = . 18, p < . 01; Evaluation MA: r = . 18, p < . 01; Everyday/Social: r = . 16, p < . 01; Passive Observation: r = . 13, p < . 05). Collectively, these results suggest that GPT-4o’s simulated students with higher math anxiety tended to establish broader associative connections to \"anxiety\" — making it a more central concept in their semantic networks — while concurrently attributing more negative emotional valence to \"math\". Unlike GPT-3. 5, GPT-4o also reflected an in- creased integration of \"anxiety\" in the associative structure, pointing to a richer yet more affectively charged representation of math anxiety. 5. 4. 2.

Experiential avoidance can also have negative repercussions on sustaining math anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010), but how could it be measured and captured in students dealing with math learning? Methods from cognitive network science can provide a deeper understanding of stu- dents’ thought processes (Dóczi, 2019), since mental representations of knowledge are part of a much more complex system, known as the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon can be defined as a repository of knowledge suited for the acquisition, processing, and use of all information that can be expressed via language (Dóczi, 2019). A key aspect of the mental lexicon is associative knowledge, a cognitive subsystem that interfaces with semantic and autobiographical memory, mapping similarities between conceptual repre- sentations, and driving recall, as well as the processing of conceptual information (Collins and Loftus, 1975; Laiacona et al., 1993; Stella et al., 2024). Numerous cognitive processes, such as word learning (Hills et al., 2009; Stella et al., 2017), creativity (Kenett and Faust, 2019; Stella and Kenett, 2019), and domain-specific competence levels (Tyumeneva et al., 2017; Siew, 2020), among many others, can all be investigated by representing associative knowledge as a network of concepts. Networks of concepts can then be further analysed quantitatively using graph theory and network analytical techniques (Siew et al., 2019b).

Behavioural forma mentis networks Network construction. Each participant read cues, provided responses and rated, in terms of valence, both cues and responses. The resulting data, encapsulated in a data frame, was used to build a BFMN for each participant. Links were built between cues and responses (responses were not linked to each other), following the past protocol established by Stella and Kenett (2019), and inspired by past works with free association data (De Deyne et al., 2013). Links were built as undirected, indicating a memory recall event involving both the cue and the response in the same way. Numerical valence ratings were transformed into categorical \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"neutral\" valence labels (corresponding respectively to the values: 1, -1 and 0) according to the protocol on individual-level BFMNs established by Stella and Zaytseva (2020). For each participant, the lower (Q1) and upper (Q3) quartiles were computed on the distri- bution of all valence ratings attributed to cues and responses. Concepts possessing more than one rating (i. e. responses being repeated twice or more) were attributed a median rating. Concepts with a rating strictly lower than Q1 or equal to the minimum value in the data were assigned a negative valence label. Concepts with a rating strictly higher than Q3 or equal to the maximum value in the data were assigned a positive valence label. A neutral valence label was assigned to the remaining concepts. This approach extracted valence labels, adapting to individuals’ affective biases; e. g. an individ..."}, {"chunk_id": 78, "chunk_index": 10, "page": 11, "section_title": "4.

Interestingly, the network features of \"math\" itself, including its degree and valence, did not significantly relate to math anxiety in this sam- ple. This absence of association could suggest either a general conceptual distancing from \"math\" or that the emotional meaning of anxiety plays a more central role in shaping math anxiety than the semantic richness of \"math\". Overall, these findings suggest that math anxiety is rooted not only in emotional responses to mathematics but also in the affective and structural organisation of seman- tic memory. A more interconnected and negatively valenced representation of \"anxiety\" appears to mirror stronger math-related fears, consistent with mechanisms such as ru- mination, which depletes working memory and heightens math anxiety (LeFevre et al., 2005; Stella, 2022). This aligns with evidence that the semantic richness of negative con- cepts sustains maladaptive emotional states and that emotional reasoning—concluding affect rather than logic (Gangemi et al., 2021)—may reinforce the negative encoding of math-related experiences. 4.
