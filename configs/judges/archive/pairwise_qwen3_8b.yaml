description: >-
  Pairwise comparison judge using Qwen3 8B for head-to-head model evaluation.
  Latest generation model with enhanced reasoning, superior at creative tasks
  and instruction following. Uses thinking mode for better judgment quality.

# Qwen3 Thinking Mode:
# - Qwen3 has a "thinking" mode that enables chain-of-thought reasoning
# - By default (temperature > 0), thinking is enabled
# - The model outputs <think>...</think> tags with its reasoning
# - We use temperature 0.1 to enable thinking while keeping outputs focused
# - Stop sequences include </think> markers for proper parsing
# - See: https://ollama.com/library/qwen3:8b
