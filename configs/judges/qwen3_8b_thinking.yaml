# Qwen3 8B Judge Inference Configuration - WITH Thinking Mode
# =============================================================================
#
# This config specifies the MODEL used to run judge prompts (instruction.yaml, rag.yaml).
# It does NOT contain the evaluation rubric - that comes from judge_config.
#
# Why Qwen3 8B?
# - Different model family from the generators (Qwen 2.5 0.5B)
# - Avoids self-preference bias where models rate their own family favorably
# - 8B parameters provides sufficient reasoning capacity for complex rubrics
#
# Thinking Mode (temperature > 0):
# - Qwen3 outputs <think>...</think> tags with chain-of-thought reasoning
# - Improves judgment quality through step-by-step evaluation
# - Slower but more thorough than non-thinking mode
#
# Usage:
#   Set as judge_inference in experiment plan:
#   defaults:
#     judge_inference: ../judges/qwen3_8b_thinking.yaml
